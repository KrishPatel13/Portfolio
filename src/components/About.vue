                I am a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> based in <strong>New York City</strong> 
                working for <strong>Figma</strong>. I've been working full time in the industry since 
                July 2023 but prior to this, studied <strong>Computer Science</strong> at the 
                <strong>University of Toronto</strong> with an emphasis on <strong>Software Engineering</strong>.
                During my time there, I obtained <strong>1+ year(s) of experience</strong> interning 
                across a few software companies in Canada. Iâ€™ve also helped build/teach a few courses
                surrounding low-level concepts in computer science. Currently, I
                have an interest in <strong>distributed systems</strong> and <strong>cybersecurity</strong>
                but ultimately wish to make an impact within the industry! To learn more about me or
                keep in touch, keep scrolling!
